# DDD

## Coding Practices

## Principles

### Functional approach (FP)
- Prefer pure functions
- Use invariant data structures
- Isolate side effects
- Ensure type safety

### Domain Driven Design (DDD)
- Distinguish between value objects and entities
- Distinguish between domain-service and application-service
- Aggregation ensures consistency
- Abstraction of data access in repositories
- Bounded context aware

### Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Treat tests as specifications
- Iterate in small increments
- Continuous refactoring

## Implementation Patterns

### Typescript Definition

```typescript
// Branded types for type safety
type Branded<T, B> = T & { _brand: B };
type Money = Branded<number, “Money”>;
type Email = Branded<string, “Email”>;
```

### value object

- Invariant
- Identity based on value
- Self-verification
- with domain manipulation

````typescript
// create function with validation
function createMoney(amount: number): Result<Money, Error> {
  if (amount < 0) return err(new Error(“Negative amount not allowed”));
  return ok(amount as Money); }
}
```

### Entity

- Identity based on ID
- Controlled updates
- with integrity rules

### Domain Service

- The group of functions that implement domain knowledge
- It is implemented as a pure function without side effects, handling only the processing of pure business logic without any involvement of external libraries.(Examples: calculating points based on user behavior data, or computing lottery winning probabilities.)
- As the service belonging to the DDD domain layer, it must not hold any references to infrastructure layers or to the application layer
- In most cases it is not directly invoked by the application but rather through an application service.
- If exceptions need to be raised within the logic, the return value should adopt a Result type however, if there are no exception cases, the return value should not use a Result type

```typescript
// argType and ReturnType are required

export const SampleDomainService = ({ input }: { input: number }): Result<number, Error> => {
  if (input <= 0) return err(new Error(’should be positive’))

  // logics

  return ok(output)
}
```

### Application Service

- The group of classes that implement specific use cases by coordinating multiple domain objects and services
- It implemented as classes often using dependency injection, depend on infrastructure layers such as repositories and transaction managers
- It is directly invoked by the application (e.g., UI or API).
- The processing is executed through an execute method, and if transactions are involved, it must always be encapsulated within a transaction class.
- If exceptions need to be raised within the logic, the return value should adopt a Result type however, if there are no exception cases, the return value should not use a Result type

```typescript
@injectable()
export class SampleApplicationService {
  constructor(
    @inject('ITransactionManager')
    private transactionManager: ITransactionManager,
    @inject('SampleDomainService')
    private sampleDomainService: SampleDomainService,
  ) {}

  async execute(): Promise<Result<number, Error>> {
    return this.transactionManager.begin(async (tx) => {
      return this.sampleDomainService.execute()
    })
  }
}
```

### Result type

```typescript
type Result<T, E> = { ok: true; value: T } | { ok: false; error: E }
```

- Explicit success/failure
- Use early return pattern
- Define error types

### Repository

- Handle domain models only
- Hide persistence details
- Provide in-memory implementation for testing

### Adapter Pattern

- Abstraction of external dependencies
- Interfaces are defined by caller
- Easily replaceable for testing

## Implementation Steps

1.**Type design**.
   - First, define types
   - Type the language of the domain. 2.

2.**Implementation from pure functions
   - Write functions with no external dependencies first
   - Write tests first

3.**Separate side effects**.
   - Push IO operations to function boundaries
   - Wrap operations with side-effects in Promise

4.**Adapter implementation**
   - Abstraction of access to external services and DB
   - Prepare mock for testing

## Practices

- Start small and expand incrementally
- Avoid excessive abstraction
- Focus on types rather than code
- Adjust approach depending on complexity

## Code style

- Function-first (classes only if necessary)
- Utilize invariant update patterns
- Flatten conditional branches with early returns
- Enumerated definitions of errors and use cases

## Testing strategy

- Prioritize unit testing of pure functions
- Repository testing with in-memory implementation
- Build testability into design
- Assert first: work backwards from expected results
