# Refactor

- Analyze current uncommitted changes and refactor the codebase
- Identify and remove unused functions and any temporary scripts created during development phases
- Find logically duplicate code and consolidate to reuse a single logic implementation  
    - if it's typescript and MCP typescript is installed, use it to find duplicate code
- Run formatters and fix any issues found
